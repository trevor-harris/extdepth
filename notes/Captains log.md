# Captains log

- prior to 1/20 - Created C++ and R versions of the functions from Naveens paper on extremal data depth. Have not tested on actual data yet.
- 1/20 - worked on making the fast_ed funtion faster. Incredibly slow however. Needs work or maybe I should give up on it. I have no idea why its so slow since it should be performing far fewer calculations.
- 1/23 - Finally fixed the C++ code. Its now a whole lot faster.
